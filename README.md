Optimizing Conversion: Participant Onboarding Funnel Analysis

This repository contains the full analysis and visualization of the participant journey for an Apurba HiTech program, focusing on the four key stages of the onboarding funnel: 
REGISTERED, WORKSHOP ATTENDED, SIGNED UP, and PAID. The project aims to understand participant drop-off rates and the average time spent at each stage, segmented by 
Participant Type (Academic vs. Employed), to provide actionable insights for improving conversion rates and user experience.

The analysis revealed that the 

Employed participant type has a higher conversion rate (30%) compared to Academic participants (20%). The final output is a comprehensive dashboard for management, detailing drop-out points and conversion rates.

üî¨ Example Usage Scenario

A program manager wants to understand the best stage for intervention to maximize paid conversions:
1.	They check the 
Overall Dropout Rate % chart on the dashboard.
2.	They observe the largest drop-off (60.00%) occurs between 
REGISTERED and WORKSHOP ATTENDED.
3.	Action: The manager concludes that the priority for intervention is implementing reminder systems or more engaging pre-workshop content to encourage registered participants to attend the workshop.
